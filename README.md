# glade60

Thank you for your interest glade60 project!

glade60 is a Bluetooth-enabled compact 60% ortholinear keyboard inspired by the [Lumberjack keyboard](https://github.com/peej/lumberjack-keyboard). It is named "Glade" after the open space in a forest that the lumberjack also has as its looks.

This is a work-in-progress project, and all information in this repository are not yet complete. I am in the process of designing and building the glade60, and everything in this repository is subject to change as I proceed development.
Please note that some of artifacts in this repository may not yet be functional. 

We welcome your feedback and contributions as I continue to develop this project. Please feel free to submit any issues or pull requests, and I will do my best to review them in a timely manner.

## Features

- 60% ortholinear keyboard
- Bluetooth connectivity
- Visible component in a standard 60% tray-mount case

## Firmware

Only ZMK can support this keyboard due to some license issues on QMK. 
Please clone [this repository](https://github.com/peej/lumberjack-keyboard) and follow the instruction for the firmware. The main ZMK repository does not support "glade60" yet.

## Component cover

Cut a piece of 2mm thick acrylic to size (95x57mm) and drill 4 m2 holes in the corners for the standoffs. Use the PCB or cover.dxf as a guide for the hole positions, you can also use cover.dxf for laser cutting the correct size acrylic.

Affix the 4 standoffs to the PCB with screws from underneath the PCB. Use the remaining 4 screws to attach the acrylic to the top of the standoffs.

## Matrix information

Please [refer this information](https://github.com/peej/lumberjack-keyboard#matrix-information) if you're willing to build your own firmware yourself.

## PCB design

The data is available in [OSHWLab](https://oshwlab.com/mikyk10/glade60)
