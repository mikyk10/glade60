# glade60

Thank you for your interest glade60 project!

glade60 is a Bluetooth-enabled compact 60% ortholinear keyboard inspired by the [Lumberjack keyboard](https://github.com/peej/lumberjack-keyboard). It is named "Glade" after the open space in a forest that the lumberjack also has as its looks.

This is a work-in-progress project, and all information in this repository are not yet complete. I am in the process of designing and building the glade60, and everything in this repository is subject to change as I proceed development.
Please note that some of artifacts in this repository may not yet be functional. 

I welcome your feedback and contributions as I continue to develop this project. Please feel free to submit any issues or pull requests, and I will do my best to review them in a timely manner.
